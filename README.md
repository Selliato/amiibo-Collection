# amiibo-Collection
amiibo collection manager - Homebrew for 3ds

The goal of this future app is to provide an amiibo collector album for the Nintendo 3DS completed by scanning amiibo with the NFC Reader of the old 3DS or buil-in reader of the New 3ds.

To compile this application you need devkitpro and the last version of ctrulib. ( https://github.com/smealum/ctrulib )
